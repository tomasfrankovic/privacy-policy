        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Gaming Shop Tycoon &mdash; Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Gaming Shop Tycoon ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile game. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users, including children.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>In short:</strong> We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from our users. The only data processing that occurs is through third-party advertising services.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not directly collect, store, or process any personal data from our users. Gaming Shop Tycoon does not require account creation, login, or any form of personal information to play.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Advertising (Unity Ads)</h2>
        <p>Our game displays advertisements provided by Unity Ads. Unity Ads may collect certain information automatically in order to serve ads, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (such as advertising ID)</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>General device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
            <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed by Unity Technologies in accordance with their own privacy policy. You can review Unity's privacy policy at: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Gaming Shop Tycoon is suitable for players of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children or any other users. Unity Ads is configured to comply with applicable children's privacy regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and applicable provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) relating to children.</p>
        <p>We serve age-appropriate ads and have enabled Unity's child-directed treatment settings where required. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has somehow provided personal information through our game, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no user data at risk on our systems. Game progress is stored locally on your device only.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is typically no data to access, modify, or delete. If you wish to reset your advertising identifier or opt out of personalized advertising, you can do so through your device's settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Reset advertising ID or Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
